        <p>
          The ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown—there are only
          speculation and folk tales. One story involves Marie Antoinette, the
          Queen of France who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before
          her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of
          Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized
          possessions, including six of her favourite Turkish Angora (or
          possibly Siberian) cats. Although she did not make it to the United
          States, all of her pets managed to reach the shore of Wiscasset,
          Maine, safely, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and
          developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.

          The first mention of Maine Coon cats in a literary work was in 1861,
          in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903). F.R. Pierce, who
          owned several Maine Coons, wrote a chapter about the breed. During the
          late 1860s, farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and
          held the "Maine State Champion Coon Cat" contest at the local
          Skowhegan Fair. In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show
          in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted
          at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown
          tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred
          Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in
          Show. The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers' Association
          (CFA) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital
          Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean
          Baker Rose Memorial Library. In the early 20th century, the Maine
          Coon's popularity began to decline with the introduction of other
          long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the
          Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat
          show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The
          breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the
          breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was
          considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The
          Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by
          Ethylin Whittemore, Alta Smith, and Ruby Dyer in an attempt to
          increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held
          cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is
          noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine
          Coon. The Maine Coon was denied provisional breed status—one of the
          three steps required for a breed not yet recognised by the CFA to be
          able to compete in championship competitions—by the CFA three times,
          which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973. The
          breed was finally accepted by the CFA under provisional status on 1
          May 1975 and was approved for championship status on 1 May 1976. The
          next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon,
          with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In
          1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the
          official state cat. Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat
          breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.
